# Domain: JHA Compliance

## What is a JHA?
A Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) is a safety document completed before starting work. It identifies potential hazards for each step of a job and documents control measures to mitigate those hazards.

## Required Elements (OSHA-aligned)
1. **Job identification:** Date, location, task description
2. **Crew identification:** Names of workers, supervisor
3. **Hazard analysis:** For each job step, identify hazards and control measures
4. **PPE requirements:** What protective equipment is needed
5. **Acknowledgment:** Workers sign to confirm they've reviewed and understood hazards

## Timing Rules
- JHA must be completed **before work begins**
- New JHA required when conditions change (weather, equipment, personnel)
- Forms must be retained for audit (typically 5 years)

## Signature Requirements
- All crew members must sign
- Signature confirms: "I have reviewed the hazards and control measures for this job"
- Digital signatures are acceptable for compliance

## Delegation Rules
- A superintendent can complete a JHA on behalf of a field worker (e.g., over the phone)
- Delegated forms must still capture all required elements
- The superintendent acts as the submitter; crew signatures still required

## Common PPE Categories
- Hard hat
- Safety glasses
- Hearing protection
- Gloves (type varies by task)
- Safety boots (steel toe)
- High-visibility vest
- Fall protection (harness)
- Respirator
