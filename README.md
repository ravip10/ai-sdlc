# AI-SDLC

A spec-driven development system for building products with AI. Combines the PM rigor of structured specs with the execution engine of phase-based AI coding.

**Three territories, one flow:**

```
PM writes specs/  →  Designer fills design/  →  Engineer builds with .planning/
                          ↓
                    AGENTS.md (auto-generated map)
                          ↓
              discuss → plan → execute → verify
                          ↓
                    Shipped product
```

## Philosophy

Most AI coding tools skip the hard part. You describe an idea, AI generates code, and you get inconsistent results that fall apart at scale. The problem isn't the AI — it's the inputs.

This system enforces a simple rule: **spec before code.** Every feature needs a JTBD spec. Every domain rule needs documentation. Every phase gets explicit implementation decisions before planning starts. The AI reads these specs and builds exactly what was specified.

The result: product decisions live in specs (where PMs can review them), not buried in prompts or code comments.

## Quick Start

### New Project (Greenfield)

```bash
cd your-project
# Copy this template into your project
cp -r ai-sdlc/* .
cp -r ai-sdlc/.claude .

# Launch Claude Code
claude

# Bootstrap
/ai-sdlc:init
```

### Existing Project (Brownfield)

```bash
# Copy template files
cp -r ai-sdlc/.claude .
cp -r ai-sdlc/specs .
cp -r ai-sdlc/design .
cp -r ai-sdlc/.planning .
cp ai-sdlc/CLAUDE.md .

# Launch Claude Code
claude

# Map your codebase first
/ai-sdlc:map-codebase

# Then bootstrap
/ai-sdlc:init
```

## How Building Works

Planning always happens inside Claude Code with human guidance:

```
/ai-sdlc:plan-phase N
    ↓
researcher agent → planner agent → plan-checker agent
    ↓
PLAN.md (task checklist)
```

Building has **two paths** from the same PLAN.md:

```
                    PLAN.md
                       │
        ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
        │                             │
        ▼                             ▼
   PATH A                        PATH B
   Interactive                   Ralph Loop
   (inside Claude Code)          (outside Claude Code)
        │                             │
        ▼                             ▼
   /ai-sdlc:execute-phase N      ./scripts/loop.sh build
   executor agent                fresh context per task
   human reviews each task       fully autonomous
        │                             │
        └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                       │
                       ▼
              PLAN.md updated
              - [ ] → - [x]
                       │
                       ▼
              /ai-sdlc:verify-work N
```

### Path A — Interactive (inside Claude Code)

```bash
claude
/ai-sdlc:execute-phase 1
```

- Executor agent works through tasks one by one
- You review, provide feedback, adjust
- Good for: complex work, learning codebase, nuanced decisions

### Path B — Ralph Loop (outside Claude Code)

```bash
exit  # leave Claude Code
./scripts/loop.sh build 01-core-feature
```

- Fresh Claude context per task (no context rot)
- Fully autonomous, auto-approves tool calls
- Good for: well-specified phases, overnight runs, batch execution

### Task Format

Both paths use markdown checklists in PLAN.md:

```markdown
- [ ] **Create user profile component**
  - Files: `src/components/UserProfile.tsx`
  - Spec: `specs/jobs/01-user-views-profile.md`
  - Action: Create Card with avatar, name, email using shadcn components
  - Verify: `pnpm build` passes, component renders correctly
  - Done: Profile displays user info with proper styling

- [x] **Set up database schema**
  - Files: `prisma/schema.prisma`
  - ...
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `- [ ]` | Pending |
| `- [x]` | Completed |
| `- [!]` | Blocked |

## PMCoach Integration

This repo is the output target for PMCoach. PMCoach coaches PMs through spec creation and writes directly to `specs/`. You don't need PMCoach to use this repo — specs can be created manually or via `/ai-sdlc:spec-draft`. PMCoach just makes it faster and higher quality.

## Examples

See `examples/` for complete worked examples of the framework in action:
- **jha-safety-forms/** — Mobile safety compliance forms for construction (shows specs, domain rules, planning, and implementation)

## Credits

Built on patterns from:
- **[Ralph Wiggum](https://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-ralph-wiggum)** — Autonomous loop execution with fresh context per iteration
- **GSD** (TÂCHES) — Phase execution, multi-agent orchestration
- **PM-OS** — Skills architecture, sub-agent reviewers, context management
- **AI-SDLC Framework** — Role separation, AGENTS.md, domain persistence
